                            <p>I was born in Scotland, grew up in Devon and from the outset I knew that my life would be
                            centred around Art.</br>At the age of nineteen I completed a diploma in <strong>Foundation studies at Plymouth College of Art and
                            Design</strong>, before embarking on a degree in <strong>Fine Art Painting at the University of Brighton</strong>. Six months
                            of my degree was spent studying at <strong>Lâ€™Ecole des Beaux Arts in Bordeaux</strong>.</p>
                            <p>
                            Following my graduation, I went to work at <strong>Plymouth Theatre Royal Production workshop</strong>, where I
                            painted scenery and props, then I decided to undertake a <strong>Post Graduate Certificate in Education</strong>, and
                            on completion of the course I taught Art at a secondary school in Cornwall. After three years of
                            teaching I moved to London where I studied for an <strong>MA in Fine Art Printmaking at Camberwell
                            College of Art</strong>, before returning to teaching in West Berkshire, where I have lived and worked since
                            2002.</br>
                            I have exhibited at numerous venues in the south west, south east and London.</p>
                            <p>I work in <strong>paint, print and mixed media</strong> and the imagery is derived from experiences that have
                            sparked my imagination. This might revolve around a place, a film, a structure or a concept.</br>I have
                            been working increasingly with <strong>found materials</strong> and find that this imparts a life of its own to my
                            visual language. Each element of a composition has a significance, origin and story.</p>
